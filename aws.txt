Four months ago I saw a post about AWS on twitter which peeked my interest.I 
did an extensive research about it and I finally decided to get the AWS 
Solutions Architect - Associate certification. After months of self learning
, hands on labs and a cold feet which almost made me reschedule my exam date
 I can finally call myself an aws certified solutions architect associate. I
can't wait apply everything I learnt in my future projects.
